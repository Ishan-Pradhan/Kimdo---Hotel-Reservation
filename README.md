# Kimdo Hotel Reservation 
Developed a hotel reservation website for Kimdo Hotel as a project using PHP. The site features an intuitive interface, enabling room searches, real-time availability checks, and easy reservations. This project serves as a practical demonstration of my web development skills, focusing on creating effective online booking systems.
